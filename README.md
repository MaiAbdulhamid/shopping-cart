# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
- Create Project with typescript template -> `$ create-react-app shopping-chart --template typescript`
- Redux -> `$ yarn add react-redux @types/react`
- Redux toolkit -> `$ yarn add @reduxjs/toolkit`
- Everything changes the store is described by action.
- `action` has `type` and has kind of `payload`.
